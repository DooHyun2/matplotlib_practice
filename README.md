This project is a small practice for understanding LLZO-like ionic conductivity trends
using synthetic data. The dataset includes dopant fraction, density, grain-boundary 
fraction and temperature. Visualization (matplotlib), linear regression, RandomForest,
and Optuna tuning were used to check basic correlations.
